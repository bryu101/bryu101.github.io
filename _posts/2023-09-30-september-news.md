# NSF Support for "NEWRITE" Project

In September 2023, we are thrilled to announce that our team has received NSF (National Science Foundation) support for the "Mid-scale RI-1 (M1:DP): National Testing Facility for Enhancing Wind Resiliency of Infrastructure in Tornado-Downburst-Gust Front Events (NEWRITE)" project. This exciting project involves the collaborative efforts of several distinguished researchers, including Drs. Partha Sarkar, Alice Alipour, D. Zhou, and G. Yan.

# Zhangming's Publication in Physics of Fluids

In another noteworthy achievement, Zhangming's research on aerodynamic whistles-based ultrasonic tone generators for bat deterrence has been published in the prestigious journal "Physics of Fluids." We invite you to read Zhangming's publication and delve into the fascinating world of ultrasonic tone generators for bat deterrence.

You can access the publication [here](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pof/article/35/9/097118/2911424/Aerodynamic-whistles-based-ultrasonic-tone).

We are excited about these recent developments and look forward to sharing more updates in the future.
